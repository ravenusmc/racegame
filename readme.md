  This is a simple 'racing' game made with pygame. I did hand draw the race car image-yes it is pretty bad! 
  This game works by having blocks fall from the ceiling and you have to move to the left and right to dodge the falling blocks. Thus, the falling blocks give one the feeling that they are racing down the road.
